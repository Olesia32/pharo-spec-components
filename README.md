## About the Library

The **Spec Components Library** is an extension to the Spec 2 framework in Pharo, providing a comprehensive set of reusable and stylable user interface components. It addresses several common limitations of the standard Spec 2 toolkit, such as the lack of multi-select dropdowns, inline validation, or paginated tables, and introduces higher-level abstractions that simplify UI construction.

This library was designed with the following objectives:

- Provide a **broader range of UI components** that are frequently needed in real-world desktop applications, such as enhanced dropdowns, form builders, notification overlays, and time pickers.
- Enable **component-level visual styling** via a Smalltalk API, eliminating the need for manual STON-based style configuration.
- Maintain **full compatibility with Spec 2**, conforming to its architecture and lifecycle model.
- Support **declarative and flexible form composition**, allowing developers to define layouts and behavior with minimal boilerplate code.
- Ensure that all components are **modular, composable, and testable**, making them suitable for both prototyping and production environments.

The library integrates seamlessly into the Pharo environment. It can be used alongside standard Spec 2 components or as a foundation for more advanced UI development. Its unified approach to layout, interaction, and styling helps streamline interface creation while promoting code reuse and consistency.

The components are particularly well-suited for building:
- configuration dialogs and wizards,
- multi-step user workflows,
- search and filter panels with pagination,
- stylized input forms with validation and feedback,
- administrative interfaces and internal tools.
